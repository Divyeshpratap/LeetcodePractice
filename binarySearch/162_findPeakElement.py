'''
A peak element is an element that is strictly greater than its neighbors.

Given a 0-indexed integer array nums, find a peak element, and return its index. If the array contains multiple peaks, return the index to any of the peaks.

You may imagine that nums[-1] = nums[n] = -âˆž. In other words, an element is always considered to be strictly greater than a neighbor that is outside the array.

You must write an algorithm that runs in O(log n) time.

            mid = (left + right)//2

                pos = binarySearch(left, mid - 1)
            elif (mid < len(nums) - 1) and nums[mid + 1] > nums[mid]:

            else:
                pos = mid

            return pos

        return binarySearch(0, len(nums) - 1)
